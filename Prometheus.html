    <h1 class="prometheus">The concept</h2>
  <p>This game is a semi-adventure puzzle game based around the <em class="orange">Prometheus' Ignition</em> -- a tool that can instantly scan and weaponize any technology.<br /> The idea was birthed on the backs of games like <em class="orange">Legend of Zelda</em>, and, very loosely, <em class="orange">Skyrim</em>.</p>

    <h1 class="prometheus">The story</h2>
  <p><em class="orange">Izanagi</em> and <em class="orange">Izanami</em> are codenames of a scientist-engineer duo who once achieved <strong class="orange">godlike mastery and understanding over futuristic technology</strong>.<br /> Their sons and daughters once also ruled the world with an iron fist, and seeded the world with devices and heirlooms.<br />
<br />
One by one, though, they went to find their parents, and began to vanish.
<br />
Your world's scientists have finally, after nearly a century of peace and fear, found the ability to deliver someone to the alternate dimension they believe Izanami and Izanagi went, to find any technology that they may have left behind.
<br />
It's a one-way trip, but the immortals clearly went there and came back, so surely there must be some technology for them to return.
<br /><br />
<em class="orange">...At least, that's what they told you.</em>
<br />
You know that you're expendable, just a young boy of no particular noble line, and you're holding one of the last weapons of mass destruction (at least, that's what the global coalition of scientists' fear)<br /> - <em class="orange">Prometheus' Ignition.</em> A device that stores different technologies, given the blueprints, and is able to weaponize it instantly in a smaller format.
<br /><br />
This is the last one, and it has been left untouched, up until now.</p>
